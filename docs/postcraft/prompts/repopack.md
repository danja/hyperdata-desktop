I wish to package up key information to help write extensions for pulsar. The extensions will need to reuse existing UI elements, as well as http and other protocols for remote call. I've made more changes to repopack.config.json, but when I try to use this as Claude Project knowledge it still reports 238% of knowledge capacity used. The current config is below. Please take another look at tree.txt in your project knowledge and consider what you know already about the legacy Atom editor and Pulsar editor and suggest other parts that may be safely ignored.
